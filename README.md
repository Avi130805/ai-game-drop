# AI Game Drop

This repository hosts a simple collection of mini-games. A small test suite ensures that the links on the home page point to real files.

## Running Tests

Install Python 3 and run:

```bash
python tests/test_game_links.py
```

The script parses `index.html` for game links and verifies that each linked file exists.

## Day 6 Cube Timer

The repository includes an interactive cube timer game for day&nbsp;6. You can
play directly in your browser by opening `games/day6/index.html`. A desktop
version built with Tkinter is available via `games/day6/cube_timer.py`.
